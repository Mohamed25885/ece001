HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it's the only markup language for designing websites,
markup language means it defines the text document within tag that defines the structure of the website
hypertext language means it defines the links between web pages. So, HTML is a mixture of them both
HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee , the first version was in 1991 known as HTML but the first standard one was in 1991 as HTML 2.0, the latest version was published in 2017 as HTML 5.2.
CSS and JavaScript both can be used in HTML code to provide more features, functions, and facilitate creating the design, HTML is easy to learn and write as it mainly consists tags and elements so you simply have to know each tag and its attributes to be able to write it. It can be written in any editor even Notepad
.It can only make a static website, JavaScript is used to make the webite dynamic.The file extension of it is .html or .htm
