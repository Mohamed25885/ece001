CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet ,
 CSS is used  to describing how HTML needs to be designed/displayed.
 It helps in saving  lots of  time as it saves writing multiple of lines on HTML to get the required design,
 CSS can control several of lines or even pages,
 for example by using Classes and ID. CSS makes the designing of websites much easier saving both efforts and time.
 CSS is said to be the cornerstone of web designing besides HTML and JavaScript. 
 Itâ€™s used to make a separated shape of how the text, files, images, layouts will be designed saving it in .css file format to be used while writing HTML code,
 by that way, a lot of time is saved instead of writing attributes in each tag in HTML,
 the latest version of CSS is CSS 3
